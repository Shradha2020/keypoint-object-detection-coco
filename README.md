# keypoint-object-detection-coco
Built Key point Detection Model using Transfer Learning with Detectron 2 (Fast R-CNN R50-FPN) and Tensorflow2 (Efficient Det D1/D2/D3) on the COCO Data Set as part of COCO LVIS Challenge 2020 



# Data Set : 
Used the COCO 2017 Dataset (train2017 and val2017 ) from https://cocodataset.org/#download  for the training.
For trying tensorflowâ€™s Efficient Det, used the tfrecords hosted in a public Cloud Storage bucket gs://cloud-samples-data/ai-platform/built-in/image/coco/.

# Task Selected for COCO Challenge
